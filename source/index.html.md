# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to share as much about myself as I can: background that forms who I am, style preferences and tendencies, assets & deficits, expectations the leadership team has of me, and core beliefs that, while fungible, are more firm than others as a result of 15+ years of startup and community building experience.

#	Personal Background

Here's some personal background that influences Ben’s behavior, style, beliefs.

Each of us has foundational events from our past, usually our youth, that are highly influential on our thinking, our beliefs, our behaviors, our identity. The following are a few vignettes from my background that have had significant impact on my makeup.

## Hating school / Being labelled high potential
I can pinpoint the time period around 3rd grade where I went from thinking I was just not smart enough to being singled out as having high potential and this change in label really altering my course. Prior to this, I would get so frustrated by timed multiplication tests and how I could never finish them in time, that I swore an oath to hate math forever. I got into trouble for acting out and I was never really interested in getting good grades. It wasn’t until some form of standardized test was put in front of me that my parents, my teachers, and most importantly myself, started to view me differently. Having the confidence that I wasn’t average or below but, instead was above average changed my trajectory.  

## Parental divorce / Lack of attention
When I was 8 my parents got divorced and I lost a huge source of affection and attention in my father. Even prior to the divorce, my mom had changed - physically and emotionally into someone who was pretty self-focused and not interested in her children. She chose to undergo gastric bypass surgery (stomach stapling) to lose weight. Once she lost over 100lbs she became very self-centered eventually driving my dad away. The loss of affection from my mom and my dad at once—made me seek attention, approval, and affection from others. This was only exacerbated by my mom’s marriage to another man and my father’s joining another family as he remarried. In a lot of ways it was this inattention from early on that has served as subconscious motivation for me to this day in ways I am only beginning to uncover.

## Moving, instability, and change
At one point when I was 14 years old, my family and I had moved homes 13 times—in some cases only staying at a place for 2-3 months. Most of these times we due to financial mismanagement, poor planning, or other reasons that 6 year old Ben didn’t understand at the time. My parents always lived beyond their means and it was always a source of stress. We got used to packing and unpacking but also to letting go of things and embracing change. To this day I am pretty comfortable adapting to large changes in my life.

## Met my wife at a young age
My wife, Jena, and I met when we were 16 and we have been together more or less ever since. Since neither of us were fully formed humans at that time, we have really altered the way each of us has developed. Most of these are for the better as we sort of have opposite backgrounds, viewpoints, and approaches to many things. However, our sense of who each of us is individually is blurred because neither of us have been an adult human separate from each other. Sometimes it is hard to separate us.

#	Style Guide

I’ve taken several variations of the Myers Briggs and come out as a Pressure-Prompted ENTP.  Extraverted (v. Introverted); iNtuitive (v. Sensing); Thinking (v. Feeling) and Perceiving (v. Judging). The extroversion means I recharge by being around people—though I see this swinging more towards I in recent years, I am still firmly in the E range.  The iNtuitive aspect means I love seeing patterns (often by using data) rather than having a strict “by the facts and only the facts” approach. The Thinking aspect means I’m frequently only concentrating on the logical aspects of a problem or my surroundings rather than the emotional aspects. The Perceiving aspect means preferring flexibility and using my gut to evaluate the situation versus being highly structured, list-oriented, process oriented rather than preferring flexibility and using my gut to evaluate the situation.

I’ve also undergone several in-depth 360-degree feedback reviews using products like the Voices product from Korn Ferry which evaluates across 69 (at the time) attributes. I have the full report and refer to it frequently to assess which skills I use effectively, overuse, or need to compensate for (in the case of weaknesses). I’ll try to have this available for people to check out.

#	Assets & Deficits

Most people who read this will explicitly understand what we mean by personal “assets and deficits”. These are the personal characteristics or traits that have great potential to enhance the quality and effectiveness of our teamwork (“assets”) or, conversely, could significantly harm the team (“deficits”).

## Assets
- I am curious and optimistic
- I’m passionate
- I want things to be the best they can be
- I care about people and have empathy for those with whom I work closely
- I’m loyal
- I’m creative
- I allow room for mistakes
- I try to put things into perspective for coworkers who are stressed/worried
- I can pick things up quickly and understand complex ideas
- I use humor effectively
- I am forgiving and tend to not hold grudges or ill-will
- I am collaborative and seek to empower people in their own work
- I deal with change well when it comes up (see point below on ambiguity for flip side)
- I want what’s best for my coworkers and reports

## Deficits

```javascript
remember that I am also quick to forgive :)
```

- I am pressure-prompted. This is a nicer way of saying I tend to procrastinate.
- I make a lot of typos and often don’t catch them in emails
- I’m often critical of others
- When my expectations for a scenario aren’t met I get frustrated
- Even as a manager I tend to get down into specific detailed tactical work that - I should likely delegate
- I am not detail oriented. I tend to get the big picture in my head for something and then move to the next big picture.
- I’m impatient
- I’m easy to excite / annoy / anger
- I often feel like I have to speak to think
- (Related to above) I don’t often provide the right amount of eye contact when I am speaking, though I tend to when I am listening.
- I’ve only recently become more introspective and aware of my subconscious motivations
- I don’t like ambiguity and will seek to reduce it through planning
- I have a hard time forming habits (good and bad)

#	Coaching Ben

I haven’t tried this yet but it sounds like a great idea from Tim that I want to attempt it. We can walk for non-feedback/coaching events as well :) The best way to coach me or give me feedback is to take me for a walk.  Because conflict can be challenging, especially when I feel like I’ve done something wrong or harmful or “bad”, it’s much easier for us to be going in the same direction, headed to the same goal, not “facing off” with each other and, thus, talking about how I can be a more effective leader, participant in a relationship, collaborator or manager.
